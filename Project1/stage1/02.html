	The New Typography [1923]  
	
	<br>Laszlo Moholy-Nagy  </br> 

	<br>Typography is a tool of communication.</br>

	<br> It must be communication in its most intense form.</br> 

	<br>The emphasis must be on absolute clarity since this distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of ancient pictographic forms.</br>

	<br>Our intellectual relationship to the world is individual-exact (e.g.,this individual-exact relationship is in a state of transition toward a collective-exact orientation).</br>  

	<br>This is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later collective- amorphous mode of communication.</br>

	<br> Therefore priority: unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions. </br> 

	<br> Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori aesthetics. </br>
