	<h1>The New Typography [1923]</h1>  Laszlo Moholy-Nagy
	<h2>Typography is a tool of communication. </h2> It must be <em><strong>communication in its most &nbsp;I&nbsp;N&nbsp;T&nbsp;E&nbsp;N&nbsp;S&nbsp;E&nbsp; form.</em></strong> The emphasis must be on <strong>absolute clarity</strong> since this distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of ancient pictographic forms. 

	<h3>Our intellectual relationship to the world is individual-exact</h3> (e.g.,this individual-exact relationship is in a state of <em>transition toward a collective-exact orientation)</em>. This is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later collective- amorphous mode of communication. 

	<br><br><strong>Therefore priority: unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions.</strong><br> Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori aesthetics.
