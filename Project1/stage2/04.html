<h1>The New Typography [1923]</h1>  Laszlo Moholy-Nagy<br><br>

<h2>Typography is a tool of communication. </h2>It must be communication in its most intense form.
<h3>The emphasis must be on absolute clarity</h3> since this distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of ancient pictographic forms. <h4>Our intellectual relationship to the world is individual-exact</h4> (e.g.,this individual-exact relationship is in a state of transition toward a collective-exact orientation).This is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later collective- amorphous mode of communication. <h5>Therefore priority: unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions.</h5> Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori aesthetics.
